                  BrainyBot (managed by <a href="https://informatica.unical.it/"> DeMaCS </a>) is a delta robot capable
                  of playing match-3 games and ball-sorting puzzles by acting on mobile phones. The robot recognizes
                  objects of different colors and shapes through a vision module, is capable of making strategic
                  decisions based on declarative models of the gameâ€™s rules and of the game playing strategy, and
                  features an effector that execute moves on physical devices. Our solution integrates multiple AI
                  methods, including vision processing and answer set programming. Helpful and reusable infrastructure
                  is provided: the vision task is facilitated, while robot motion control is inherently simplified by
                  the usage of a delta robot layout.
