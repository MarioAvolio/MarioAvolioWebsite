              Greetings,

              I am Mario Avolio, an accomplished Computer Vision & Artificial Intelligence Engineer. My academic journey
              commenced with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the esteemed University of Calabria, Italy.
              Building upon this strong foundation, I furthered my education with a Master's Degree in Computer Science
              from the University of Milano Bicocca, Italy.

              My professional focus is centered around the intricate domains of Artificial Intelligence and Computer &
              Robot Vision. My expertise is particularly honed in the intricate fields of Deep Learning and Machine
              Learning. I adeptly utilize tools and frameworks such as PyTorch, Python, Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to
              craft intelligent systems that encompass perception, learning, and astute decision-making.

              With a comprehensive background spanning Data Science and Software Engineering, my capabilities extend
              beyond AI and Vision. I adeptly navigate the landscape of data to distill insights, while also
              architecting robust software solutions that stand the test of complexity and scale.

              My ethos revolves around the conviction that technology is the conduit to our future. I am steadfastly
              committed to pushing the frontiers of possibility, be it unraveling the intricacies of neural networks or
              architecting algorithms that embody efficiency and elegance.

              My dedication to innovation is rivaled only by my commitment to professionalism. As an engineer who
              thrives in a dynamic and demanding environment, I consistently deliver solutions that amalgamate
